<u> BACKGROUND OF THE CONFLICT </u> </h3>
<br>
<h2 div align="center">Sovereignity and independence of the Nagas on the basis of universal laws governing the origin and exristence of all nations on earth.[A historical,political, and cultural background of the Indo-Naga with glimpses of Naga history and denfence of their ancestral lands from the second second century to the end of the British era (AD 150-1947)] </h2>
<br>
<h3> UNIVERAL LAW-I</h3>
<b>No nation on earh exist without a concrete geographical land. <img src="515.jpg>
<br>
<h3> UNIVERAL LAW-II</h3>
The national identity of a nation is inseperable from the geographical identity of that nation.
<br>
<h3> UNIVERAL LAW-III</h3>
The nation and geographical indentities of a nation are indestructible and unchangeable. </b>
<br>
<p> Premise upon which the three universal laws are built:</p>
<h4 div align="center"> And HE[God] made from one[Adam] every nation of men live on all the faces of the earth,<h4> <h4 div align="center">having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their habitation.</h4><h5 div align="center">(Acts 17:26,RSV)</h5>
<br>
These three universal laws governs the origi and existence of any nation on earth in the past or present. All war between nations that have ravenged this planet earth throughout human history is the result of violating these three universal laws. The Indo-Naga war that ravenged the Naga country for the past fifty-two years(1947-1999) is a result of India's violation of these laws with respect to Nagaland.This war of agression and invasion on the part of India has led to death of over two hundred thousand Nagas through torture,rape,starvation,diseases and indiscriminate murder.The war still continues unabated and unresolved to date. India had been employing thousands and thousands of its military,paramilitary and police forces in Nagaland to enforce its authority.
<br>
<br>
Many a times in Nagaland's violent political history, the numbers of these ocuupational forces had almost equalled the local Naga popuation. But due to stict censorship of the press and a Restricte Area Permit necessary for entry into Nagaland,the story of this conflict has been kept untold both by the foriegn press and even the Indian press.Various attempts have also been made by Indian politicians and writers to delibrately twist historical facts and project political lies to claim that Nagas are Indians and that Nagaland is Indian territory.
<br>
<br>
The author will therefore establish the true facts of the conflict by subjecting the issues involved in the conflict to a test of truth through the three posited uiversal laws that gover the origin and existence of any nation on earth. As already mentioned,this deemed necessary in order to clear the many lies and distortions of the truth  that have been fed to the general piblic of India and the world at large  by the Government of India.

<u> <h3> UNIVERSAL LAW-I</h3></u>
<b>  No nation on earth exists without a concrete geographical land.</b>
<br>
<br>
No nation on earth,no individual in human history has come into extistence without a concrete geographical reference point.This is to say that no nation on earth and no individual in the world has fallen into earth from outer space.The political history of every nation has its origin in some concrete geographical land.Within the boudaries of this geographical land the people of the land develop their national identity,their cultural identity and their political identity.The inhabitants of the land call the land their land.The Nagas,like any other nation on earth,call their geographical land Nagaland.Corresponding to the fact,there is a geographical land Britain for the British,a geographical Russia for the Russians and a geographical India for the Indians.
<br>
<br>
By a tragic twist of history,Nagaland in the 20<sup>th</sup> century was severed in two through a treacherous betrayal by the British Govenment. Burma was gifted with half and the other half fell under Indian domain.Those areas that fell under Indian territory were further subdivided into four fragments,namely- Assam,Manipur,Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland.Thus,within the Indian territory,large chunks of Nagaland and Naga people were put into three other states against the wishes of the Nagas.This was done to reduce the Naga political issues to the smallest possible geographical area.The present Indian state of Nagaland comprises only 16,579 sq.km with a population of hardly over one million people.
<br>
<br>
However,in actual fact,the greater Nagaland including those areas in Myanmar comprises over 1,20,000 sq.km.This area is located between 25<sup>o</sup> 60' and 27<sup>o</sup> 40' latitude North of equator and between the longitudinal lines 93<sup>o</sup>20' E and 95<sup>o</sup>15' E.The total population of the entire Naga people of the actual Nagaland for which all Nagas have been fighting for,for all these sixty-two years is over five times the size of Israel with a population of about four million people.(For a list of all Naga tribes,see Appendix-I).
<br>
<br>
Like all other nations on earth the Nagas have been inhabiting their land since time immemorial.But,though they had been inhabiting their lands for many generations,the Nagas learned to read and write only in the later part of the 19<sup>th</sup> century through the British and the American Missionaries.Prior to this,except for oral traditions,the Nagas did not have any recorded or written history of their own.However,other external historical records confirms that the Nagas have been in their land for many centuries.
